        Hi I'm George. Iâ€™m a Software Engineer working in the UK. I graduated
        from the <a href="http://www.ox.ac.uk/">University of Oxford</a> in 
        Chemistry in 2016, but quickly switched from science to software 
        after that! I currently know/work in C#, SQL, HTML5, CSS3, and a bit
        of Javascript. I'm always interested in learning new things so don't
        hesitate to <a href="/">reach out!</a> ðŸ˜Š
