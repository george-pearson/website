        Hi I'm George. Iâ€™m a Software Engineer working in the UK. I graduated
        from the University of Oxford in Chemistry in 2016, but quickly switched
        from science to software after that. I mostly use C#, SQL, JavaScript
        and a bit of Python at work. I'm always interested in learning
        new things so don't hesitate to <a class="blue-link" href="mailto:george-pearson.business@outlook.com">reach out!</a> ðŸ˜Š
