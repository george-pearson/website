I've finally shipped! After about a month of what seems like going backwards and forwards I've made my first post on my brand new website. I‚Äôm going to try and do at least one post a month, and I plan to keep them relatively short. I can‚Äôt promise they won‚Äôt end up longer though if I really get into it!

## Jekyll and GitHub Pages

So you want to know how I made this site right? Well initially I was thinking of using what I know from work - C# [ASP.NET MVC](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/apps/aspnet/mvc). But I figured it would be better if I learnt something new and all that server side setup and maintenance seemed like a pain. After a recommendation from a friend I found that GitHub offers **free hosting** for websites running [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/). This seemed perfect for what I needed and no server side hassle! From GitHub Pages I was directed to [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/). Jekyll is an amazing open source blogging tool, which among other things has inbuilt support for [Markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) making writing blog post as breeze[^1].

Here's an example of the JavaScript markdown which uses [Pygments](http://pygments.org/):
```javascript
(function() {
    console.log("Hello World! üòä");
})();
```

Jekyll also has a great HTML templating through use of [includes](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/includes/) and [layouts](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/step-by-step/04-layouts/) which help keep your project well structured.

## Sass and Gulp
At work we predominantly use CSS libraries like [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/), but one thing I decided fairly early on was that I was going to develop all the CSS myself to improve my front-end skills. After a bit of online research I decided I was going to use the [Sass](https://sass-lang.com/) CSS templating language. Here's the Sass for those crazy blue links:
```css
$color--skyblue: #00c1c1;
$color--white: #fff;

%transition-duration {
    transition-duration: 0.5s;
}

%blue-links {
    color: $color--skyblue;
    text-decoration: none;
    background-image: linear-gradient(
        to top,
        $color--skyblue,
        $color--skyblue 50%,
        transparent 50%,
        transparent);
    background-position: 0% 0%;
    background-size: 100% 200%;
    @extend %transition-duration;

    &:hover{
        color: $color--white;
        background-position: 0 100%;
    }
}
```
Sass makes your CSS code simpler with things like variables `$color--skyblue`, placeholder selectors `%transition-duration` and parent selectors `&:hover`. Essentially Sass means you don't have to repeat yourself so often!

While investigating Sass I was directed to [Gulp](https://gulpjs.com/) a DevOps build tool. Gulp essentially allows you to automate command line tools for things like:

- Compiling Sass files to CSS when they change.
- Minifying JavaScript and CSS files.
- Running a Jekyll build when a markdown file is updated.
- Reloading your browser once a build is complete.

This makes development a lot easier and faster. Here's an example of a gulp command that compiles a Sass file and minifies the outputed CSS:
```javascript
/**
 * Compile .scss files.
 */
gulp.task("sass", function () {
    return gulp.src("_scss/main.scss")
        .pipe(sass().on("error", sass.logError))
        .pipe(cssnano())
        .pipe(rename("main.min.css"))
        .pipe(gulp.dest("assets/css/"));
});
```

## Conclusion

In fact creating this website was a lot easier than I imagined thanks to all the great freely available open source tools on the web. Now that I started writing about some of these tools I realised most of them probably need an entire post to be explained with any detail. So I might be doing some "idiots guide to..." posts in the near future. Anyhow hope you enjoyed my first post and are looking forward to the next instalment. üòè
